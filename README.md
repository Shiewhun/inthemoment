# In The Moment

A photo gallery application with its backend implementation written in Go, and the UI being a sourced template.
The Caddy related files are there because it is intended to be hosted on a Caddy server.
I might have to change the "inthemoment" domain name to something else as inthemoment.com is already taken.
I felt "inthemoment" captured the idea of a picture, but the current content under that domain name is something about motivational speakers - make of that what you will.

No Docker related content here because I am still in the process of learning how that works in deployment. But I hope this application shows my familiarity with authentication, security, working with API's, code organization and competency with basic elements of the Go programming language.
